Hi, my name is Jamie and I am currently pursuing my masters in international economics and finance at Brandeis. I also recently accepted a full-time position in asset management at Fidelity Investments that will be starting in June!
One student in my section is Kat Messenger. She is pursuing her MBA at Brandeis, and will be graduating in December 2024. Kat also earned her undergraduate degree from Brandeis, where she studied Business with a concentration in Innovation & Strategy. She minored in economics and East Asian studies. 
The second student in my section is Ben Rogak. Ben is pursuing his MBA as well, and will be graduating in December of 2024!
